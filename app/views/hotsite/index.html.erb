<h1>Wellcome to Pede.pizza</h1>

<p>It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home! Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!</p>

<p>All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this. All right. What's your plan? Uh...Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you. Okay. Han, you put these on. Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind. Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...but, ah...what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here? Lock the door! And hope they don't have blasters. That isn't very reassuring.</p>

<p>And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!</p>
